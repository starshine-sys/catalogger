# Catalogger

This is the rewrite of Catalogger.  
The original bot's foundation was written in about a weekend, and it's spaghetti all the way down.

The [`main`](https://github.com/starshine-sys/catalogger/tree/main) branch is the original branch,
though we aren't adding new features to it, only major bugfixes.  
Any new features will be in this branch (`rewrite`)

When the rewrite is finished, this branch will be renamed to `main` and the original branch will be renamed to `legacy`.
